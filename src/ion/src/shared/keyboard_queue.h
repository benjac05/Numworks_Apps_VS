   * respectively), and cannot interrupt other queue operations (svcall could
   * theoretically interrupt pendsv as its priority is higher but this cannot
   * happen in practice as the pendsv handler does not use SVCs).
   * FIXME If a push occurs while the queue is busy, the State is temporarily
   * stored in m_pushedWhileBusy, to be pushed later when the original
   * operation completes. A more thorough solution would be to temporarily
   * increase the current interruption priority (active interruptions can be
   * infered from the NVIC_IABRx register). If other problems involving
   * concurrency arise, we could develop a Transaction class based on this
   * mechanism. */
