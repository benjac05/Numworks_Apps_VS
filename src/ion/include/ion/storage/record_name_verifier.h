/* This is used by the storage to know if it can store a record with
 * a specific name. Two main reasons can prevent a record from being created:
 *  - Restrictive extensions
 *  - Reserved names
 *
 * == Restrictive extensions ==
 * Some records extensions are restrictive, which means that two records with
 * the same base name and one of these extensions can't exist at the same
 * time in the storage.
 * If a record's extension is not a restrictive extension, it means that it can
 * coexist with any record of a same base name and a different extension.
 * For instance, test.py can coexist with test.func, but test.exp can't
 * coexist with test.func.
 * The precedence score of an extension indicates if it can override
 * an other extension with the same base name.
 *
 * If precendeceScore1 <= precedenceScore2 record1 can override record2
 * If precedenceScore1 > precedenceScore2, record1 cannot override record2
 *
 * The restrictive extensions are registered by the AppsContainer in Apps.
 *
 * == Reserved names ==
 * Some names are reserved for specific extensions, such as V1, X1, or N1
 * which are reserved for the list extension.
 * This means that a record can be name V1 only in two cases :
 * If it is a list OR if no list named V1 exists.
 * To do so, the list extension is considered having a precedence score lower
 * to any other score if it is reserved for the base name.
 * So if X1.func exists in the storage, X1.lis will override it, even if
 * the list extension has usually an higher precedence score.
 *
 * Since we want V1, V2 and V3 to be reserved, we store "V" in prefixes and
 * 3 in prefixRepetitions.
 * For u, v, and w, reserved for sequence, prefixRepetitions = 0
 *
 * The reserved names are registerd by each app, when the snapshot is
 * instantiated.
 * (Sequence registers u, v and w, Regression registers X1, Y1, etc.)
